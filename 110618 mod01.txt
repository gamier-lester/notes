WORLD WIDE WEB
how the internet started?
a. 1950's - computer's can only process one task at a time
it is called "batch-processing"
-internet was used by scientists
-1917 => "time-sharing" can process several tasks at once.
-1960 => technologies that will pave a way for internet was created
-one concept was called "packet-switching", it is introduced by NPL
(National Physical Laboratory). technique of transmitting long messages
-packet loss occurs wherein one or more packets of data travelling across
a computer network fail to reach their destination.
-packet-switching was used by ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency)
has four universities: UCLA SRI UCSB UU
-ARPANET network formed by connecting these institutions
oct 29, 1969 first message sent over ARPANET. received "Lo" Sent "Login"
-1973 ARPANET became international with a sattelite network
-internet means interconnected networks
-vint cerf and bob kahn developed tcp/ip to have a shared standards
-01 1 1983 switched to tcp/ip
-vint cerf and bob kahn are recognized as the Fathers of Internet
-application, internet, network interface. Layers of network
Network interface.
-communicates using wired or wireless means
-wired connection, electronic signals. wireless, radio waves.
-modem, converts binary data to transmit over a channel
-ISP's are middlemen
Internet layer.
-"device-to-device communication"Internet Protocol: identification of each device 
connected to the network,the format of the messages, routing the messages from 
the source to the destination.
-device identification. Ip addresses are assigned to a device
-127.0.0.1 => loopback address (localhost)
Domain Name System. Naming system that maps a domain name to a specific
ip address
parts of a domain: 
third label domain or subdomain / host => subdomain.website.com
*describes the function of the website
second level domain / sld => www.sld.com
top level domain / tld => www.website.tld
*instant way to understand what a website is about or where is it based

--------
Internet layer
-Message format => a message should be broken into fixed sized segment
called packets. packets will be sent to the routers and forwarded to the
target segments
header 96bits . payload 892bits. trailer 32bits
-Packet Routing => packets sent from pc contains the ip address of the computer(destination)
routers use this ip address to forward them
-packet routing

Application Layer
*Internet vs. World Wide Web* // they are not the same
Internet connects the machine
Web connects people / information
-world wide web is the system we use to access the internet
*client requests from server; server responses to the requests*
-clients are the typical web user's internet-connected devices
-servers are computers that store web pages, sites, or apps.

-URL => Uniform resource locator. Global address of the documents and other resources on
the world wide web
it has several parts:
.protocol => https://
.domain name => www.facebook.com
.directory / folder => /foldername
.web page => /login
.-file extension => .asp

HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol
HTTPs - Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure
POP - Post office protocol
smtp -

domain name => unique reference that identifies a website on the internet
directory => actual location of the file that we want to access
File extension => type of file of the web page being viewed. if a file cannot be found
, a 404 not found error will usually be returned by the server
Browsers => people access websites using a software called
web browser

Web server => special computer that are constantly connected to the
internet, and are optimized to send web pages out to people who
request them.

devices => people are accessing websites using devices. ex. mobile phone

Screen readers => Programs that read out the contents of a computer
screen to a user.

How websites are created?
a. HTML. HTML w/ CSS. HTML w/ CSS w/ Bootstrap. HTML w/ CSS w/ Bootstrap
